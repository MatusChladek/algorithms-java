# Algorithms in Java

* **BFS** - with simple Web Crawler implementation (memory complexity is O(n))
* **DFS** - Topological ordering, Cycle detection (memory complexity is O(logn))
* **Dijkstra algorithm** - searching for shortest path algorithm on positively weighted DG
* **Bellman Ford algorithm** - searching for shortest path algorithm on DG
* **Lazy Prim algorithm** - build spanning tree from a given vertex, adding smallest edge to MST
* **Travelling Salesman Problem** - solved by Simulated Annealing
